jQuery Tabbed Slider Gallery
============================

Overview
--------

A multi-plugin-dependent jQuery widget that provides a slider-like navigation, which, when the navigational items/tabs in the slider are selected, each load different content for the selected item/tab in a designated content area on the page.

The initial implementation of this widget was done on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuftsschildmeyer.com/">homepage of the Tufts Schildmeyer Funeral Homes website</a>

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuftsschildmeyer.com/tabbed-slider-gallery/jquery-tsg.php">A standalone verison of the widget on said site can be viewed, at this link.</a> (Note: some layout and/or styling will be a little off, as the containing page has some styles that aren't being inherited on this standalone page.)

Components
----------

### jQuery plugins

There are a few components that go into the Tabbed Slider Gallery widget, including:

* [jQuery UI 1.8.16 Tabs] (http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#cookie) - This plugin controls the switching of the content in the main section when the user clicks on the respective callout boxes/buttons/tabs in the slider/carousel

* [bxSlider] (http://bxslider.com/) - 
This plugin renders the callout boxes/buttons/tabs in the slider/carousel and renders the previous and next button functionality
    
* [jQuery Cycle Plugin] (http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/) - This plugin is active on the 'Locations Near You' content window and is responsible for cycling the three location slides through the fading transition

Refer to the documentation on these plugins to customize the behavior of any of the aspects/features demanded from the design

### Google Web Fonts

The widget also uses Google Web Fonts, although, using FontSquirrel on future implementations is recommended (better FOUC prevention).

* [Google Web Fonts] (http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Amaranth:regular,regularitalic)

Please note that the "jQuery Tabbed Slider Gallery" widget was developed while in the employ of FuneralNet; all programmatic library components were/are sourced, combined, enhanced, and shared by me, GitHub user, 'bericson', and are used under GPL and/or Creative Commons Licensing. Any graphical files referenced are done-so only for demonstration/portfolio purposes, with no reuse of said assets pertaining to Tufts Schildmeyer allowed. Much thanks. ~ BE/FN, 2012.06.05</span>
